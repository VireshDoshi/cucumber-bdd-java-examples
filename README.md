# cucumber-bdd-java-examples
Demo of Java BDD cucumber-jvm 


This cucumber-BDD example demonstrates:  
1. Selenium WebDriver with BDD  
2. REST api with BDD testing ( updated example as seen here http://clearqa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/fun-with-cucumber-jvm-bdd.html)


Notes:  
1. it uses a Maven POM File  
2. execution is done in Eclipse  ( jUnit test or a cumcumber feature test)
